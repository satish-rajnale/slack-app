# Slack-app
  This is a slack-clone app. My very first project on pushed to github.
  I have used styled-components for css and redux as my data store and firebase/firestore for my backend authentication and data store.

### 1. Login Page:
A authentication sign in is required here to access the app. But dont worry cuz its a firebase provided auth process and I dont have any means to access or misuse the information.
